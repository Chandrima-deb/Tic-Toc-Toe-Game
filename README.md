This repository contains a Python implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game for two players. The game is played entirely in the console, making it simple and interactive.

Dynamic board display: The game board updates in real-time after each move.

Win detection: The program checks rows, columns, and diagonals to determine the winner.

Draw detection: If the grid is full and no winner exists, the game declares a draw.

Input validation: Ensures players only enter valid moves.
